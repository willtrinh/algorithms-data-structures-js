| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Best) | Time Complexity (Average) | Time Complexity (Worst) | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | $$O(n)$$               | $$O(n^2)$$                | $$O(n^2)$$              | $$O(1)$$         |
| Insertion Sort | $$O(n)$$               | $$O(n^2)$$                | $$O(n^2)$$              | $$O(1)$$         |
| Selection Sort | $$O(n^2)$$             | $$O(n^2)$$                | $$O(n^2)$$              | $$O(1)$$         |
| Merge Sort     | $$O(nlogn)$$           | $$O(nlogn)$$              | $$O(nlogn)$$            | $$O(n)$$         |

- Bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent. (All have quadratic average time complexities.
